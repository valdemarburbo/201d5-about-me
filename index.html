            <h2>Biography</h2>

            <p>Valdemar Burbo is one of the most well known potato farmers in Lithuania. His sheer will, cunning mind and determination of a hungry vulture layed the foundations of his successful potato business. Last year, Valdemar's farm yielded a whopping 20,000 tonnes of our beloved starchy vegetable, making him the top potato supplier in the Baltic region.</p>

            <p>Valdemar does not care about vanity - he is main focus is efficiency and profit. That is why the majority of his clothes are made out of recycled potato sacks, his mattresses are filled with dried potato peels and the vodka he consumes to celebrate his success is distilled out of potatoes.</p> 
                
            <p>Occasionally, Valdemar enjoys to bury himself in a potato field fertilised with manure and dwell there up to a couple of days. He explains this unusual ritual in his own words: "If one seeks success in the potato business, one must strive to become a potato."</p>
